# Data Analytics Projects:

### [1. NBA Analytics](https://github.com/ellaarchie/projects/blob/main/Home_Advantage_by_sport.ipynb)
* Individual contribution to a collaborative Cal Poly MSBA capstone project, partnering with a prominent North American utilities company.
* Employs the "onlineBcp" R package for real-time detection of significant shifts in power output time series data using Bayesian probabilities.
* Utilizes anonymized historical data for a single constraint, illustrating constraints as power grid limitations influenced by factors such as transmission capacity, generation limits, network topology, and regulations; constraint flow represents the electricity flow within these constrained segments.
* Identifying substantial changes in constraint flow enables utilities companies to proactively maintain grid stability during regime changes by alerting them in advance.

### [2. Political Affiliation](https://github.com/ellaarchie/projects/blob/main/Political_Affiliation_Analysis.ipynb)
* Survey data cleanup: Conduct general preprocessing of survey responses to ensure data quality.
* Dimensionality reduction: Use Sci-kit Learn's PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce survey dimensions while preserving important information.
* K-means clustering: Perform k-means clustering on the transformed data using Sci-kit Learn to identify distinct customer segments.
* Cluster labeling: Apply the cluster labels to the original data for further comparative analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigate each cluster's unique characteristics and differences to better understand customer preferences and behaviors.
* Marketing strategy suggestions: Leverage insights from the cluster analysis to propose tailored marketing strategies for each customer segment.tilizes Sci-kit Learn package to reduce survey dimensions with Principle Component Analysis and perform k-means clustering on the transformed data.

### [3. Home Advantage by Sport](https://github.com/ellaarchie/projects/blob/main/Home_Advantage_by_sport.ipynb) 
![cover photo](https://github.com/ellaarchie/ellaarchie.github.io/blob/main/homeadvantage.png?raw=true)
* Consolidating and processing seven years of Big Mac Index and World Happiness data into a unified dataframe for analysis.
* Conducting an exploratory data analysis to examine the potential correlation between the Big Mac Index and World Happiness scores.
* Utilizing Pearson's correlation coefficient to quantitatively assess the relationship between the two indices.

### [4. Snapchat Forecasting](https://github.com/ellaarchie/projects/blob/main/Snapchat_Forecasting.ipynb)
![snap cover photo](https://github.com/ellaarchie/ellaarchie.github.io/blob/main/snapchat_covid.jpeg?raw=true)
* Eliciting requirements and establishing business rules for the development of a relational database using MySQL, tailored for a pop-up ordering system.
* Creating an advanced Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to ensure a comprehensive database structure and verifying the normalization of tables for optimal performance.
* Developing a functional prototype, including a database creation script, to facilitate rapid deployment and testing of the system.
* Effectively demonstrating the ordering workflow through a series of well-structured SQL queries and the utilization of dummy data, showcasing the system's capabilities and potential for real-world applications.

### [5. Financial Time Series Project](https://github.com/ellaarchie/projects/blob/main/Financial%20Time%20Series%20Final%20Project%20Report.pdf)
